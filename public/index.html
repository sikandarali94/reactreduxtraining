<!--
To install the create-react-app package globally, we write the command in the terminal:
npm install -g create-react-app
After having done so we can then use this command to create a react app:
create-react-app project-name
In 'project-name' we can name it anything we like.
If we have NodeJS 5.2 or higher we can achieve the above two steps with this single command:
npx create-react-app project-name

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
