// To show something to the page using React, we should follow these steps:

// 1. Import the React and ReactDOM libraries. We are using the bundler Webpack to import the libraries.
import React from 'react';
/* In NodeJS, typically we use require statement rather than the import statement like this:
const React = require('react);
The import statement uses ES2015 modules system to grab code from other packages while the require statement uses
CommonJS modules system.
 */
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// 2. Create a React component.


// 3. Take the React component and render it on the page.
